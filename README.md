To help members of parliament vote for amount to allocate to counties

The counties revenue allocation formula drew varying reactions from leaders and political parties. This led to tension among both houses to whether tom pass the bill or not.
To avoid a replay of this, this code helps each Mp allocate weights to factors that he considers important. The average weights is then determined and the fund allocated.
Thus, democratic decisions have been made from Mps vote rather than a all-or nothing decision.
